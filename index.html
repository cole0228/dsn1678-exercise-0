		<p>55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.</p>

		<p>The usually deep purple roots of <strong>beetroot</strong> are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.</p>

		<blockquote>I have some weird habits. For instance, <strong>I love beets.</strong> Show me a salad bar and I will
clean them out of their beets.<cite>Chris Pratt</cite></blockquote>
